In addition, it opens lines for his bishop and queen, while preparing rapid development and kingside castling."

          "comment": "[%csl Re5,Ge4,Gd4] White's third most popular move is 3. d4, after 3. Bb5 (the Ruy Lopez) and 3. Bc4 (the Italian). Firstly, some people might wonder why one would want to play the Scotch Game. I see a handful of benefits to playing the Scotch over the alternatives: 1. It's less common than both the Ruy Lopez and Italian game. This means that your opponents are less likely to be thoroughly-prepared for it and they should of course have less experience in it as well. 2. Unlike the Ruy Lopez (and the Italian to a lesser extent), Black's options are very limited. While black in the Ruy Lopez can choose from almost a dozen different defences, the Scotch boils down to two main lines. This makes the Scotch a bit easier to learn since there are fewer sidelines. 3. The Scotch can lead to a variety of different, interesting positions and structures which are hard to come by in different openings. This means that the Scotch should certainly appeal to creative and experimental chess players. So what is the idea behind 3. d4? Basically it boils down to the centre. In the Ruy Lopez or Italian, White's plan is often to play d4 after lengthy preparation with c3 and so on. This means that White can recapture on d4 with the pawn (which is superior to capturing with the knight) but the downside is that Black is often not forced to take on d4! He typically would guard the e5 strongpoint and would very rarely relinquish control of the e5 pawn since it is his only real central foothold. This does come at a cost however. White spends one tempo to carry out this d4 break. Instead of developing his bishop and quickly castling, white has opted for a central break which grants him a larger centre. In the mainlines, Black tries to exploit this loss of time by quickly generating threats against both the undefended e4-pawn and the unstable knight on d4. Therefore, after 4. Nxd4 Black's two main choices are ...Bc5 and ...Nf6. These will be covered in the following two chapters while this chapter will examine what White should do when Black deviates earlier.",

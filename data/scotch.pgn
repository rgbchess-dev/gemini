1. e4 { White's most popular first move attracts World champions and
novices alike. Chess newcomers naturally gravitate towards it while many
World Championships were decided by it. Fischer's move, together with 1.
d4, has the simple plan of taking over the whole centre by playing d4 on
the next move. In addition, it opens lines for his bishop and queen, while
preparing rapid development and kingside castling. } 1... e5 { Black avoids
the wild, unbalanced Sicilian or the exotic French and Caro-Kann and
instead heads for the solid Open Games. } 2. Nf3 { [%csl Re5] A natural
move - White attacks e5 and develops. By developing his kingside knight,
White is one move closer to short castling. } 2... Nc6 ( { Black replies
similarly - he covers the pawn and develops. However, Black has other
options at his disposal - most notably } 2... Nf6 { , the Petroff Defence }

be covered in the final lines of this course. }) 3. d4 { [%csl Re5,Ge4,Gd4]
White's third most popular move is 3. d4, after 3. Bb5 (the Ruy Lopez) and
3. Bc4 (the Italian). Firstly, some people might wonder why one would want
to play the Scotch Game. I see a handful of benefits to playing the Scotch
over the alternatives: 1. It's less common than both the Ruy Lopez and
Italian game. This means that your opponents are less likely to be
thoroughly-prepared for it and they should of course have less experience
in it as well. 2. Unlike the Ruy Lopez (and the Italian to a lesser
extent), Black's options are very limited. While black in the Ruy Lopez can
choose from almost a dozen different defences, the Scotch boils down to two
main lines. This makes the Scotch a bit easier to learn since there are
fewer sidelines. 3. The Scotch can lead to a variety of different,
interesting positions and structures which are hard to come by in different
openings. This means that the Scotch should certainly appeal to creative
and experimental chess players. So what is the idea behind 3. d4? Basically
it boils down to the centre. In the Ruy Lopez or Italian, White's plan is
often to play d4 after lengthy preparation with c3 and so on. This means
that White can recapture on d4 with the pawn (which is superior to
capturing with the knight) but the downside is that Black is often not
forced to take on d4! He typically would guard the e5 strongpoint and would
very rarely relinquish control of the e5 pawn since it is his only real
central foothold. } (3. d4 { on the other hand takes a very different
approach. White makes his central break early which forces Black to play }
3... exd4 (3... d6 { is not good, which will be demonstrated later. }) {
After } 4. Nxd4 { White will have an extra pawn in the centre - e4 - while
Black was forced to exchange his e5 pawn. As a result of this e4 pawn,
White has better control over the centre. }) { This does come at a cost
however. White spends one tempo to carry out this d4 break. Instead of
developing his bishop and quickly castling, white has opted for a central
break which grants him a larger centre. In the mainlines, Black tries to
exploit this loss of time by quickly generating threats against both the
undefended e4-pawn and the unstable knight on d4. Therefore, after 4. Nxd4
Black's two main choices are ...Bc5 and ...Nf6. These will be covered in
the following two chapters while this chapter will examine what White
should do when Black deviates earlier. } 3... exd4 ( { The obvious and best
move. Black is forced to cede the centre since } 3... d6 { isn't good, as
will be demonstrated. }) 4. Nxd4 { [%csl Gd4,Ge4] } ( { To be totally
honest, the Scotch Game only technically starts after this move, not 3. d4.
White had a couple of options to deviate here, such as the Scotch gambit -
} 4. Bc4 { , }) ( { and the Goring Gambit - } 4. c3 { . Neither of those
will be covered here, as this is a course dedicated to the Scotch game. })
4... Nxd4 $6 { While making this course, I was weighing up whether or not
to show this move, since it is without any doubt a mistake. However, it is
an unbelievably common mistake - it is Black's third most popular move! }
5. Qxd4 { [%csl Gd4,Rc6] The reason Nxd4 is a mistake is because it 'lures'
White's queen to a great square. Usually, a queen in the centre is
vulnerable because the opponent can gain tempi on it for free. This is not
the case here. With Black's b8-knight already exchanged, there is no
irritating ...Nc6 to chase our queen away. } 5... d6 { Black's most common
move. } 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. f3 { [%cal Gf3g4,Bc1e3,Be1c1][%csl Gg4] } ( { Our
plan in this variation is to go for a Yugoslav attack setup with Be3, O-O-O
etc. } 7. Be3 { immediately allows the extra possibility of } 7... Ng4 { ,
so this prophylactic move first is preferable. }) 7... Be7 8. Be3 { [%cal
Be1c1] } 8... O-O 9. O-O-O $16 { [%cal Bg2g4,Bh2h4][%csl Rg8] White has a
wonderful attacking position - next comes g4 and Black will have to be very
careful not to get mated within a dozen moves. White's setup resembles the
Dragon's Yugoslav attack, except Black is missing his usual Dragon
counterplay. } *

bishop for Black's good one) with a great position for white. } *

square so our b1-knight can develop there. Over the next few moves White
will develop and castle with a great position. } *

rapidly. I chose this variation since I believe it is one of the best

compared to 4... Nf6. and White's play is fairly easy to understand and
play. In general, White aims for quick development. He can opt for long
castling or short castling - it depends on the position. White has two
standard piece setups which I'll be recommending in this variation: Qe2 and
Be3 (which is best played when ...d5 isn't a threat) and Bg5 + Bd3 followed
by short castles (which is White's best option when ... d5 is a very real
possibility). The pawn structure here should be familiar to many players as
it can arise out of a number of openings - notably, the Philidor. White
gets a bit more space and central control while Black gets play down the
e-file and the possibility to carry out either the ...f5 or ...d5 breaks.
White usually wants to develop rapidly, protect the centre and then
gradually advance the kingside pawns and possibly (later) play the e5

Nc3-d5. } 5... Bb6 { The bishop retreats of course - b6 is its best square

target of these advances. } *

1. e4 { White's most popular first move attracts World champions and
novices alike. Chess newcomers naturally gravitate towards it while many
World Championships were decided by it. Fischer's move, together with 1.
d4, has the simple plan of taking over the whole centre by playing d4 on
the next move. In addition, it opens lines for his bishop and queen, while
preparing rapid development and kingside castling. } 1... e5 { Black avoids
the wild, unbalanced Sicilian or the exotic French and Caro-Kann and
instead heads for the solid Open Games. } 2. Nf3 { A natural move - White
attacks e5 and develops. By developing his kingside knight, White is one
move closer to short castling. } 2... Nc6 ( { Black replies similarly - he
covers the pawn and develops. However, Black has other options at his
disposal - most notably } 2... Nf6 { , the Petroff Defence }) ( { and }
2... d6 { , the Philidor Defence. Both of these openings will be covered in
the final lines of this course. }) 3. d4 { White's third most popular move
is 3. d4, after 3. Bb5 (the Ruy Lopez) and 3. Bc4 (the Italian). Firstly,
some people might wonder why one would want to play the Scotch Game. I see
a handful of benefits to playing the Scotch over the alternatives: 1. It's
less common than both the Ruy Lopez and Italian game. This means that your
opponents are less likely to be thoroughly-prepared for it and they should
of course have less experience in it as well. 2. Unlike the Ruy Lopez (and
the Italian to a lesser extent), Black's options are very limited. While
black in the Ruy Lopez can choose from almost a dozen different defences,
the Scotch boils down to two main lines. This makes the Scotch a bit easier
to learn since there are fewer sidelines. 3. The Scotch can lead to a
variety of different, interesting positions and structures which are hard
to come by in different openings. This means that the Scotch should
certainly appeal to creative and experimental chess players. So what is the
idea behind 3. d4? Basically it boils down to the centre. In the Ruy Lopez
or Italian, White's plan is often to play d4 after lengthy preparation with
c3 and so on. This means that White can recapture on d4 with the pawn
(which is superior to capturing with the knight) but the downside is that
Black is often not forced to take on d4! He typically would guard the e5
strongpoint and would very rarely relinquish control of the e5 pawn since
it is his only real central foothold. } (3. d4 { on the other hand takes a
very different approach. White makes his central break early which forces
Black to play } 3... exd4 (3... d6 { is not good, which will be
demonstrated later. }) { After } 4. Nxd4 { White will have an extra pawn in
the centre - e4 - while Black was forced to exchange his e5 pawn. As a
result of this e4 pawn, White has better control over the centre. }) { This
does come at a cost however. White spends one tempo to carry out this d4
break. Instead of developing his bishop and quickly castling, white has
opted for a central break which grants him a larger centre. In the
mainlines, Black tries to exploit this loss of time by quickly generating
threats against both the undefended e4-pawn and the unstable knight on d4.
Therefore, after 4. Nxd4 Black's two main choices are ...Bc5 and ...Nf6.
These will be covered in the following two chapters while this chapter will
examine what White should do when Black deviates earlier. } 3... exd4 { The
obvious and best move. Black is forced to cede the centre since ...d6 isn't
good, as was demonstrated previously. } 4. Nxd4 ( { To be totally honest,

pressure on d4, while not allowing the e5 push (as in the ...Nf6

idea which could throw you off. } ( { White has a number of decent options

Both have their advantages. 6... d6 is more flexible and retains the
possibility of castling both ways. It also avoids a possible early Bg5 pin
against the knight on f6. 6... d6 can lead to a plan of ...Nge7 as well,
instead of the standard ...Nf6. 6... d6 has the major disadvantage of
nullifying the threat of the ...d5 breaks. This is one of Black's chief
ideas after 6... Nf6. } 7. Qe2 { [%cal Bc1e3,Ge3b6,Be1c1] This is White's
standard idea which is often also employed against 6... Nf6. The reason I
didn't recommend it in that case was because of a quick ...d5 by Black.
Here, however, this isn't a problem since Black already wasted a tempo with
...d6. White intends to play Be3, developing his bishop. Moving the queen
to e2 also prepares long-castling in the future. } 7... Nge7 { [%cal
Bf7f5,Ge7f5][%csl Gf5] This move is Black's most popular choice and
showcases the flexibility of ...d6. Black doesn't want his knight on f6 to
block the f-pawn - he intends to play ...f5. } 8. Be3 { Standard
development. Black's bishop is an irritating piece so it benefits White to
exchange it. } 8... O-O 9. O-O-O { [%cal Bf2f4,Bg2g4][%csl Gc1] White's
position is perfectly suited for long-castling. Not only would short-side
castling be a few moves away, White's king is perfectly safe on the
queenside and it allows for a possible future kingside attack - White
intends to roll his f- and g-pawns forward in the future. } 9... f5 { Black
carries out his active-looking pawn break, but the fun is short-lived: }
10. exf5 $1 { Although it appears that one of Black's minor pieces will be
very active on f5, this is merely an illusion, as the next few moves will
show. } 10... Bxf5 { ...Nxf5 is met similarly and isn't much better. White
will take on b6 and then prepare to roll his kingside pawns forward,
kicking the knight back at the same time. } 11. Bxb6 axb6 12. a3 $14 {
[%cal Ga3b4,Be2d2,Bf2f4,Bh2h3,Bg2g4][%csl Gb4,Rf5,Rg8] A very strong
prophylactic move preventing any black ...Nb4 intrusions. Black seems to
have a pretty position, but the problem is that he is stuck for a plan.
White's idea is simple - he will play Qd2 and then march his kingside pawns
forward, f4, g4 and so on. Black has no equivalent plan - his queenside
pawns are hamstrung by the doubled b-pawns. I find White's position to be
very pleasant and safe here. } *

possible early Bg5 pin against the knight on f6. 6... d6 can lead to a plan
of ...Nge7 as well, instead of the standard ...Nf6. 6... d6 has the major
disadvantage of nullifying the threat of the ...d5 breaks. This is one of
Black's chief ideas after 6... Nf6. } 7. Bg5 { [%cal Gg5d8][%csl Gd5,Rf6]
As mentioned on the previous note, the problem with the more popular move
7. Qe2 is that Black can play a quick ...d5 (since our queen no longer
covers that square). Instead, I intend to modify White's setup to one which
is based on short castling. The bishop on g5 fulfills an active pinning
role and adds indirect support to the d5-square. } 7... h6 8. Bh4 O-O 9.

O-O $11 { [%cal Bd1d2,Bg1h1,Bf2f4,Ba1e1,Bc3a4,Ba4b6][%csl Rb6] A fairly
standard position for this variation has arisen. This line is probably
Black's best bet after 4... Bc5 - the position is very close to equal,
although I still certainly would play White over Black here. White should
complete development and play in the centre of the next few moves. Qd2,
Kh1, Rd1/e1, f4 are all very possible. If Black doesn't play ...a5 or ...a6
soon then Na4xb6 is a strong idea to gain the bishop pair. } *

the fight on the kingside or pressure the centre. The queen on f3 also
frees up the d1 square for one of White's rooks and allows the possibility
of Bg5xf6 (doubling white's f-pawns). Although the position may be very
close to equal, White enjoys a fantastic success rate of nearly 62%. From
the games I've examined, White has a very clear and concise plan. Firstly,
he should complete development with Bf4. Next the rooks come to d1 and
maybe e1 (depending on whether the bishop on b4 moves). Then white plays
Ne2 with the idea of playing c4. This pawn break puts serious pressure on
Black's central d5-pawn and gives White good play. If Black puts his rook
on the b-file to attack b2, simplest for White is just to play b3. Note the
importance of the e-file in this position, since it is the only open file
at the moment. Since this is small 'tabiya' for this variation, I would
recommend looking at some master games from this position and additionally
playing a few training games of your own either online or against a
computer. } *

Black has this slightly annoying check option which takes White virtually
by force into an endgame. Although some players might not like this, the
good news is that the endgame is a bit better for White. } 9. Qe2 { The

Black. Black needs the pawn on c6 to cover the b5-square for the moment. })
11. Nxd5 cxd5 12. Bb5+ { [%csl Re8,Rc6] White should try cause Black's king
some problems before he gets the chance to play ...c6. Now Black has the
slightly unpleasant choice of forfeiting castling or trading bishops and
having a king stuck in the centre of the board. } 12... Bd7 13. Bxd7+ Kxd7
14. Be3 $14 { [%cal Bh1d1,Bd1d3,Ba1d1][%csl Rd7,Gd3,Gd1,Rd5] White retains
some pressure because of Black's precariously placed king. White intends to
double up on the d-file to attack d5. Although the position is close to
equal, White is the only player who has winning chances here. While good
defence for Black will hold, a few small slip-ups can very easily lead to a
white victory. } *

1. e4 { White's most popular first move attracts World champions and
novices alike. Chess newcomers naturally gravitate towards it while many
World Championships were decided by it. Fischer's move, together with 1.

the next move. In addition, it opens lines for White's bishop and queen,

be familiar to you, of course. However instead of the natural and most
common, 2... Nc6, Black can opt for either 2... d6 or 2... Nf6. These
defences, known as the Philidor and the Petroff respectively, are
significantly rarer than Nc6, but I thought they should be covered for the
sake of completeness. } 2... d6 { The Philidor Defence - Black supports his
e5 pawn with a pawn, instead of the knight. The Philidor is frequently
essayed by players who prefer quiet and positional games - often Black will
follow up with ...Nf6, ...Nd7 ...Be7, ...c6 and ...O-O. His setup is very
flexible, albeit not that ambitious. Alternatively, he can cede the centre
- after 3. d4 - and attempt to generate counterplay down the e-file. } 3.

is that ...d6 has hardly any influence on the centre. This gives white a

have decided to recommend a simple, natural but strong setup based on Bc4,
O-O and a4. It requires very little theoretical knowledge and risks little
compared to the more flamboyant variations which usually involve g4. } 5.

queenside expansion with ...a6 and ...b5 by playing a5 to stop it. In
general, if Black captures on d4 in this position, it is safe to recapture
with our queen since there is no knight coming to c6 to harass it. White
should continue development with Re1 and Be3. From there, his plan could go
in any number of directions - one possible idea is a knight manoeuvre to f5
via h4. } *

time and keeping the king safer. On the other hand, the bishop might not be

Black's king into some trouble. Additionally, and very importantly, moving
the pawn to ...g6 gives white a 'hook' to latch onto and dark squares to
exploit. This means that White's plan will often be in the spirit of the
Yugoslav Attack (in the Sicilian Dragon). We will play Be3, Qd2, f3 and
possibly long castles. h4-h5 is one idea to open up Black's king and it's
also common trade off Black's key kingside defender with Be3-h6. Black
lacks his usual counterplay that is typical of the dragon - this is because
the wrong file is open (White will castle long and the c-file is closed,
which would normally be the basis for black's counterattack). }) 5... Be7 {

allowing for a big white kingside attack. } 6. Be2 { [%cal Be1g1] } 6...

and put his rook on the same file. I'd prefer not to rush my pawn to f4,
which could end up leaving e4 exposed. Next White will most likely play Bf4
and play along the central files. His space advantage and well-developed
pieces should grant him an edge. } *
